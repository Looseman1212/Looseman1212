### Hi there :)

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a web application that scrapes songs from Bandcamp with parameters given by the user, then can create and populate a playlist on the users spotify account with songs from the scrape!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently writing a lot of spaghetti code, avoiding tutorial hell as best I can
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything! Would like to get into building an API or creating more dynamic HTML, any oversight into how other people tackle their code would be awesome
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with what kind of desk chair will help my back
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about things to do with the world outside
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Email - maxwilliamreid@gmail.com, instagram - @yeahsickg, linkedIn - https://www.linkedin.com/in/max-reid-4621a9257/
- âš¡ Fun fact: the internal temp for a medium-rare cooked steak is about 55 degrees celsius
